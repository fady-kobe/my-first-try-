It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL).The NBA is a 70-year-old organization born from innovation. It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden owner Walter Brown realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, could be used to host basketball games.</h4>

     <h3>Playoff Jimmy is real, and spectacular … but he also might be running out of gas</h3>
     <h4>What Butler has done since joining the Heat four years ago is incredible. This is his second trip to the Finals in four seasons. Last season, he and the Heat were one late-Game-7 missed jumper away from another Finals appearance. In those four seasons, he’s played 59 playoff games and averaged 25 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.6 assists. He rarely turns the ball over, and hounds opposing stars. He also has a knack for coming through in big moments, in a way where it feels like he’s taken snatching the soul out of the body of his opponents. But it’s also worth pointing out that he’s shot just 42.4% percent over the past two series, and against the Celtics, there were times in Games 5, 6 and 7 where he didn’t seem to have any explosion or lift. 

        The Heat’s chances against the Nuggets could very well rest on Butler's ability to resummon that explosiveness that helped him break the Milwaukee Bucks. </h4>
